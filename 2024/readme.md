Challenge:

Use a different programming language every day. I hand picked a list of languages I've used at least once in the past. Each day, I will randomly select one of those languages for that day's puzzles.

The languages for each day were decided by running the following command:

shuf ./languages.txt > languages-for-each-day.txt
